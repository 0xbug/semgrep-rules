  message: |
    Detected an Expression Language segment in a tag that does not escape
    output. This is dangerous because if any data in this expression
    can be controlled externally, it is a cross-site scripting
    vulnerability. Instead, use the 'out' tag from the JSTL taglib
    to escape this expression.
