  message: |
    Detected use of the 'none' algorithm in a JWT token.
    The 'none' algorithm assumes the integrity of the token has already
    been verified. This would allow a malicious actor to forge a JWT token
    that will automatically be verified. Do not explicitly use the 'none'
    algorithm. Instead, use an algorithm such as 'HS256'.
