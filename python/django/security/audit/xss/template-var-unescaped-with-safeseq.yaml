    Detected a template variable where autoescaping is explicitly
    disabled with '| safeseq' filter. This allows rendering of raw HTML
    in this segment. Ensure no user data is rendered here, otherwise this
    is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If you must do this,
    use `mark_safe` in your Python code.
